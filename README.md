An atom is defined as the smallest particle into which an element can be divided without losing the chemical properties that characterize it


Electron: Mass (kg) = 9.1 x 10-31, Charge (C) = 1.602 x 10-19 (-)
Proton: Mass (kg) = 1.673 x 10-27, Charge (C) = 1.602 x 10-19 (+)
Neutron: Mass (kg) = 1.696 x 10-27, Charge (C) = 0
